"""
Perform KDE on a given sample (it the actual program scope such sample
is either the weights list or the biases list), then compute the histogram
bins in a way that one bin comprehends all of the data samples falling in
the region for which the data have an associated (estimated) pdf greater
that a given factor (free parameter). It returns the bins edges. 
Subsequently it is in order to use these bins edges to assign each connection
weight and bias (of the neural system) a belonging category, in that
motif mining software can deal with "colors". 


*** IMPROVEMENT: 
    
    instead of chosing an arbitrary factor in order to select which data 
    points belong to the central bin, it could be a neater choice to 
    select a smart quantile, so that there is a statistical significance

    simple logic: loop over all the samples (weights or biases),
    if the next in the serie features a y-value (that comes from
    the KDE of the samples) greater that a given threshold 
    
    AND 
    
    the previous instead has a y-value smaller that such threshold,
    then the current point separates two regions:
    By thus doing, we require that all of the samples that feature a
    value of the estimated density greater that a certain value, are 
    forced to belong to the same bin. It is done because the number
    of _colors_ that FanMod supports in limited, and a neat choice of
    the division is crucial. 
    The threshold value is motivated by the density plots of the weights
    and biases, see main text
