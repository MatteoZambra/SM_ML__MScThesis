FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\matte\Desktop\MasterThesis\newThread\all_sources_new\Results\seed_618\normal\init\init_w_Graph.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 65
Number of edges: 82
Number of single edges: 82
Number of mutual edges: 0
Number of edge colors: 2

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 100 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   exchanging only edges with the same color,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

748 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
72080 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
72828 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 29696 tries were made, 24635 were successful.
Randomization took 0.007 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.112 seconds.
