FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\matte\Desktop\MasterThesis\newThread\all_sources_new\Results\seed_618\glorot\tree\tree_u_Graph.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 65
Number of edges: 225
Number of single edges: 225
Number of mutual edges: 0

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 100 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

15186 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
1336533 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
1351719 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 97862 tries were made, 65467 were successful.
Randomization took 0.068 seconds.
Enumeration took 1.345 seconds.
