FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\matte\Desktop\MasterThesis\newThread\all_sources_new\Results\seed_618\glorot\clus\clus_u_Graph.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 65
Number of edges: 215
Number of single edges: 215
Number of mutual edges: 0

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 100 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

13016 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
1153431 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
1166447 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 91060 tries were made, 63131 were successful.
Randomization took 0.048 seconds.
Enumeration took 1.141 seconds.
