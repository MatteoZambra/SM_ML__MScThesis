FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\matte\Desktop\MasterThesis\gitpush\SM_ML__MScThesis\all_sources_new\Results\seed_620\glorot\init\init_u_Graph.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 65
Number of edges: 290
Number of single edges: 290
Number of mutual edges: 0

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 100 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

29215 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
2544813 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
2574028 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 135284 tries were made, 82208 were successful.
Randomization took 0.036 seconds.
Enumeration took 1.766 seconds.
