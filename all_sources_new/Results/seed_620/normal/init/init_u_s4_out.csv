FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\matte\Desktop\MasterThesis\gitpush\SM_ML__MScThesis\all_sources_new\Results\seed_620\normal\init\init_u_Graph.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 65
Number of edges: 160
Number of single edges: 160
Number of mutual edges: 0

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 100 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

5609 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
523240 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
528849 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 65777 tries were made, 47171 were successful.
Randomization took 0.035 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.358 seconds.
