# SM_ML__Thesis

## Aim
This repo contains the code intended to support the developing process of my Master Degree Thesis.

## Scope

Motivated by recent publications concerning the development and formalisation of a theoretical framework in which Deep Learning may fit into, this thesis topic and work is finalised to investigate the evolution of the topology of a neural system structure during the process of learning.

In the full swing of the example provided in [1], some synthetic data set are being cratfed, according to some particular morphology (e.g. binary tree structure), then these are fed to a neural network. A simple feed forward network is accounted for as model zero.
