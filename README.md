# Emergence of Network Motifs in Deep Neural Networks

## Purpose
This repo contains the code intended to support the developing process of my Master Degree Thesis. The same results are used in the article _Emergence of network motifs in deep neural networks_, linked at the end of this Readme.

## Summary

Motivated by recent publications concerning the development and formalisation of a theoretical framework in which Deep Learning may fit into, this thesis topic and work is finalised to investigate the evolution of the topology of a simple feedforward artificial neural network during the process of learning.

Network Science is thought to be an interesting standpoint. Inspired by [Milo et al. (2002)](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/298/5594/824), a simple multilayer-perceptron model is inspected as breeding ground for the emergence of network motifs, once the model is trained on different sets of synthetic data and with different initialisation schemes ([Saxe et al., 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6120), [Glorot and Bengio, 2010](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a.html)). The question addressed is whether one can appreciate the trace that the learning dynamics leaves in the form of functional modules. The neural network inspected is trained on a multi-label classification task using two different data sets. Another pivotal aspect is the influence of the initialization scheme in relationship with training efficiency. Turns out that non-trivial schemes, such as Orthogonal matrices and Glorot-Bengio schemes, could impress a sharper initial fingerprint to the initial motifs landscape, thus encouraging these motifs to develop.

An endearing biological resemblance with **kinases** dynamics in transduction networks may be appreciated (see [Alon, 2006](https://www.crcpress.com/An-Introduction-to-Systems-Biology-Design-Principles-of-Biological-Circuits/Alon/p/book/9781439837177)). Moreover, signature of diversity can be appreciated for different arrangments of data sets and initialisation schemes. It is not straightforward to understand whether this diversity stems from different initial and boundary conditions or it is a by-product of noise (for example coming from the stochasticity of the SGD algorithm).
 
## Code

### Contents

`all_sources_new` source codes. The `main.py` scripts launches what necessary 

* `DataSets` folder, which contains the scripts to generate the two data sets used. Number of data examples and other details are hard-coded. In addition, serialized files of previously created data sets are present, in order to fetch them in the simulations.
* `all_pkg` contains the modules I have written to accomplish the task. Other than Machine Learning, as Keras, and standard scientific computing libraries, NumPy, Pandas and so forth, all the code is written from scratch, from the generation of synthetic data to the utilities to read the results of the FANMOD motifs mining program (see below) and results production.
* `Results`. Here the directory relative to one seed is created, therein the results created for each initialisation scheme are stored. Those comprehend the serialized files containing motifs informations, useful to be fetched if needed. In each directory containing the results for the initialisation schemes, results relative to the data set are stored, that is, the `.h5` model from Keras and the `.txt` graph data structures used by the FANMOD program.
* `Figures`. For each seed, proper sub-directories are created, one for each initialization scheme. Moreover, a `Summary_plot` is created in order to store graphical results which comprehend all the initialization schemes and data sets scenarios.

This hierarchy is automatically created by a program run, and files are saved in a consistent fashion, in such a way to fetch the needed files in the same run or later. Note that in the `main.py` script the execution is modular: The user instructs the program whether to repeat the any of the stages in the computational workflow. Accordingly, files are created again or fetched.

### Usage

In the `main.py` file, two dictonaries are declared at the beginning of the workflow. `plot` dictionary has as keys references to plots, e.g. training metrics, parameters histograms. Values associated are boolean values, so that the user can instruct the program to whether perform a given plot, and save it in the proper folder, see above, or not.

The `again` dictionary, on the other hand, instruct the program to whether perform the respective analysis stage, in a similar fashion. This means that if the `training` item is set to `False`, then the program run omits to train the model again. Such a choice is likely to be done once the model has been trained yet, the graph data structure has been prepared for the FANMOD program (see below) and this latter has been used to mine motifs in the trained network. At this point is not necessary to perform training and preprocess, then the user tells the program to skip these stages and go stright to the post-process stage, where the FANMOD output files are fetched and their content is used to visualize the motifs informations.

### FANMOD usage in the analyses

The FANMOD software has the advantages to implement wighted (colored) network motifs mining and has a graphical user interface. It is not possible to call it from command line, hence to integrate it in the workflow of the code contained in this repository. The user must tune the workflow instructions in the aforementioned dictionaries in such a way to create the graph files amenable for FANMOD in a first run, run FANMOD so that this latter can generate the needed output files and in a second time the code should be run again, executing the postprocess stage.

In the analyses presented FANMOD has been used setting the number of random networks to compare the actual model with to be 100. Check the `CSV` option in the `Output file` menu. Check `Directed` (default choice) in the `Input file` menu. Browse the text file produced by the code run and set the name of the output file to `env_weight_size_out.csv`. `env` should be replaced by `init`, `tree`, `clus`, respectively the initial configuration, binary tree and independent clusters data sets. Replace `weight` with `u` or `w`, respectively unweighted or weighed network. In this second case check the `Colored edges` option. Replace `size` with `s4` or `s6`, respectively four or six vertices motifs. As an example, the input file for the case of binary tree data set accounting for a weighted graph will be `tree_w_Graph.txt` and it is created automatically by the program. Assume that one wants to mine four nodes motifs in this case. Then the user should call the output file (**and put it in same directory**) `tree_w_s4_out.csv`. 

Note that the directory where this input file is stored is `..\all_sources_new\Results\seed_n\init_scheme`. Here there are the `.h5` Keras model export, the FANMOD input file and the output file generated running this latter. In the postprocessing stage, the program is thought to fetch these output files from this directory.


### Remark about some coding choices
The OO-paradigm has been exploited but not aboused. For the purposes of many of the functions written, it has been realized that simple function definition were the best tradeoff between code readability, architecture clarity and modularity. The definition and usage of reduntant object types in this case would have resolved in an over-complex classes landscape, thus giving problems in an hypothetic further re-use.

## Motifs mining tool

The [FANMOD](http://theinf1.informatik.uni-jena.de/motifs/) program has been used, in that it has the capability of inspecting colored networks, as it is the case. See the linked page for relevant papers, executable, sources and license.
