# SM_ML__Thesis

## Aim
This repo contains the code intended to support the developing process of my Master Degree Thesis.

## Scope

Motivated by recent publications concerning the development and formalisation of a theoretical framework in which Deep Learning may fit into, this thesis topic and work is finalised to investigate the evolution of the topology of a neural system structure during the process of learning.

In the full swing of the example provided in [2], some synthetic data set are being cratfed, according to some particular morphology (e.g. binary tree structure), then these are fed to a neural network. A simple feed forward network is accounted for as model zero.

The main concern is the nucleation of some recurrent structures in the trained network (in the terms of [4], _network motifs_). The interest is to investigate the process of evolution of such motifs and their role (if any), and try to put this phenomenon in relationship with the learning process, that is: How the probabilistic signature of the data fed to the system is encoded in the internal structure of the network itself.
