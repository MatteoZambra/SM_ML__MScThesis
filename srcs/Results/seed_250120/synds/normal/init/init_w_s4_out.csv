FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\matte\_nmnn\srcs\Results\seed_250120\synds\normal\init\init_w_Graph.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 75
Number of edges: 151
Number of single edges: 151
Number of mutual edges: 0
Number of edge colors: 3

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 100 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   exchanging only edges with the same color,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

3398 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
349658 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
353056 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 56279 tries were made, 45182 were successful.
Randomization took 0.039 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.537 seconds.
