FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\matte\_nmnn\srcs\Results\seed_240120\synds\normal\init\init_w_Graph.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 64
Number of edges: 96
Number of single edges: 96
Number of mutual edges: 0
Number of edge colors: 3

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 100 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   exchanging only edges with the same color,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

1244 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
122778 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
124022 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 35471 tries were made, 28736 were successful.
Randomization took 0.028 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.158 seconds.
