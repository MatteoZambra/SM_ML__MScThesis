FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\matte\_nmnn\srcs\Results\seed_240120\mnist\orth\mnist\mnist_w_Graph.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 824
Number of edges: 438
Number of single edges: 438
Number of mutual edges: 0

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 100 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

94802 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
7822036 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
7916838 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 220270 tries were made, 116562 were successful.
Randomization took 0.171 seconds.
Enumeration took 9.071 seconds.
