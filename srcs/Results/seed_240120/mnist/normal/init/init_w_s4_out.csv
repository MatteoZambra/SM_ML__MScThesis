FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\matte\_nmnn\srcs\Results\seed_240120\mnist\normal\init\init_w_Graph.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 817
Number of edges: 296
Number of single edges: 296
Number of mutual edges: 0
Number of edge colors: 2

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 100 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   exchanging only edges with the same color,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

11281 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
1185763 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
1197044 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 97997 tries were made, 89595 were successful.
Randomization took 0.105 seconds.
Enumeration took 2.876 seconds.
