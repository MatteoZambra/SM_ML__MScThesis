FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\matte\_nmnn\srcs\Results\seed_450509\mnist\normal\init\init_w_Graph.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 913
Number of edges: 1032
Number of single edges: 1032
Number of mutual edges: 0
Number of edge colors: 2

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 100 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   exchanging only edges with the same color,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

88446 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
10455370 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
10543816 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 332515 tries were made, 312586 were successful.
Randomization took 0.436 seconds.
Enumeration took 31.039 seconds.
