These values try to mimick the **getting to form** connections between computing units (neurons). Note: It is up to the **gradients** to update, even of big amounts, these initially small values. It is expected that the network accomplishes the classificatin task with a satisfactory accuracy value on test examples, say $\\ge 0.95$."
